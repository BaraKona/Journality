Journality productivity app (in progress)

![](screenshot.png)
Journality is a concept brought to life during the summer of 2019 before my first year of university. The concept was to make an application to boost my productivity.

I wanted to gain some coding experience before I started my course, and having had no previous experience in computer science other than modding games and *torrenting software, it was a great place to start.*
Using visual studio, stack overflow and an impossible number of youtube videos, I brought my project to life.
